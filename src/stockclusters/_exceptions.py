"""Typed exception hierarchy for the HRP library.

A single base (:class:`HRPError`) lets callers catch any library-raised error
with one ``except`` clause, while the specific subclasses let them distinguish
data-shape problems from numerical-degeneracy problems. Importing this module
has no side effects.
