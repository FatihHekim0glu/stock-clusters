"""Cluster-aware allocation schemes and the diversification horse race.

Three strategies are compared honestly out-of-sample:

- ``1/N`` - the naive equal-weight DeMiguel benchmark.
- ``cluster-EW`` - equal weight across clusters, equal weight within.
- ``stripped-HRP`` - inverse-variance within cluster, equal across clusters.

All weights are ``shift(1)``-applied at the rebalance boundary (no look-ahead). The
frozen :class:`DiversificationResult` bundles the OOS Sharpes and the inference
outputs (Memmel-JK p-value, DSR).

Importing this subpackage has no side effects.
