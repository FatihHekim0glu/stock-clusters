"""Expected-return (mu) estimators.

Only the max-Sharpe Markowitz allocator needs an expected-return vector; HRP,
IVP, min-variance, and 1/N are mu-immune. To keep the comparison fair, max-Sharpe
is fed an explicit James-Stein / grand-mean-shrunk mu (ADR-documented), with the
naive sample mean exposed as an ablation so the reader can see that it is
mu-estimation noise — not the allocator — that sinks max-Sharpe.

All estimators return a :class:`pandas.Series` of *per-period* expected returns
labelled by asset. Importing this module has no side effects.

def james_stein_mu(returns: ReturnsLike) -> pd.Series:

    Shrinks each asset's sample mean toward the cross-sectional grand mean

    :math:`\hat{\mu}^{JS}_i = \bar{\mu} + (1 - \phi)(\hat{\mu}_i - \bar{\mu})`,

    (1961) form

    with :math:`\sigma^2` an estimate of the common residual variance. This
    materially reduces the out-of-sample MSE of the mean versus
    :func:`sample_mu` and is the ADR-documented estimator used by max-Sharpe so
    the horse race is not rigged by mu-noise.
