"""Adjusted Rand Index - the headline cluster-stability scalar.

The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) measures agreement between two labelings, corrected
for chance. The adjacent-window ARI (mean ARI between clusterings fit on
consecutive rolling windows) is the headline stability number surfaced in the
summary. ARI is also reused post-hoc to compare clusters against GICS sectors
(see :mod:`stockclusters.metrics`).

PARITY: validated against ``sklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score`` to ``1e-12``.

Importing this module has no side effects.
