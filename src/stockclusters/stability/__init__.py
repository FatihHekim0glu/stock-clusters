"""Temporal stability of the cluster assignment.

Stability is measured by re-fitting clusters on rolling windows and comparing
adjacent-window labelings. The headline scalar is the mean adjacent-window
Adjusted Rand Index (ARI); label alignment across windows (and birth/death of
clusters when ``k`` changes) is handled by Hungarian / max-Jaccard matching.

- :mod:`stockclusters.stability.resample` - rolling/resampled cluster re-fits.
- :mod:`stockclusters.stability.ari` - adjacent-window ARI (headline scalar).
- :mod:`stockclusters.stability.align` - cross-window label alignment.

The frozen :class:`StabilityResult` is the common return bundle.

Importing this subpackage has no side effects.
